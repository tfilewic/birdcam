# Birdcam
Embedded camera system with on-device bird detection and classification using machine learning.<br>
Control logic and inference in C++; model training and conversion in Python.

## Project will:
- [ ] Use a camera module to detect bird presence  
- [ ] Capture images on detection  
- [ ] Classify bird species using a ML model  
- [ ] Log detection results (timestamp, species, confidence, image path) to a CSV file  
- [ ] Upload detection data and images to a remote server  
- [ ] Provide a data visualization dashboard
- [ ] Optimize model and system for low-power, headless operation on Raspberry Pi  

## Technologies Used
- **Raspberry Pi** – embedded hardware platform  
- **TensorFlow Lite** – lightweight ML inference  
- **OpenCV** – image capture and motion detection  
- **CSV** – simple local data storage  
- **Spotfire** – data analysis and visualization

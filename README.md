# Birdcam
Embedded Linux camera system with on-device bird detection and classification using machine learning.<br>
Control logic and inference in C++; model training and conversion in Python.

## Project will:
- [X] Use a PIR detect bird presence  
- [X] Capture images on detection
- [X] Log detection results to a CSV file
- [ ] Upload detection data and images to a remote server  
- [ ] Classify bird species using a ML model  
- [ ] Provide an image viewing interface
- [ ] Provide a data visualization dashboard
- [ ] Optimize model and system for low-power, headless operation on Raspberry Pi

## Technologies Used
- **Raspberry Pi** – embedded Linux platform
- **libcamera** - RPI camera stack
- **CSV** - local data storage  
- **TensorFlow Lite** - ML inference  
- **HTML** -  simple image viewing interface
- **React** - data analysis and visualization

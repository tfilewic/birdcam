# Birdcam
Embedded Linux camera system with on-device bird detection and classification using machine learning.<br>
Control logic and inference in C++; model training and conversion in Python.

## Project will:
- [ ] Use a camera module to detect bird presence  
- [ ] Capture images on detection
- [ ] Log detection results to a CSV file
- [ ] Upload detection data and images to a remote server  
- [ ] Classify bird species using a ML model  
- [ ] Provide an image viewing interface
- [ ] Provide a data visualization dashboard
- [ ] Optimize model and system for low-power, headless operation on Raspberry Pi

## Technologies Used
- **Raspberry Pi** – embedded Linux platform  
- **OpenCV** - image capture
- **CSV** - local data storage  
- **TensorFlow Lite** - lightweight ML inference  
- **HTML** -  simple image viewing interface
- **React** - data analysis and visualization
